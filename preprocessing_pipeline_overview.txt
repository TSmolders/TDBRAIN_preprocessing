## Preprocessing pipeline:
# With pyprep package according to Bidgely-Shamlo et al. 2015 (https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fninf.2015.00016/full):
1. Remove line-noise without committing to a filtering strategy
2. Robustly reference the signal relative to an estimate of the 'true' average reference
3. Detect and interpolate bad channels relative to this reference
	- Detection by:
		a. extreme amplitudes (deviation criterion)
		b. lack of correlation with any other channel (correlation criterion)
		c. lack of predictability by other channels (predictability/RANSAC criterion)
		d. unusual high frequency noise (noisiness criterion)
# With MNE:
1. Repair EOG, ECG, and EMG artifacts with ICA (fitting ICA to high-pass filtered copy of eeg data, but applying to unfiltered eeg data)
2. BP filter (1, 100)
3. epoch data
(4. baseline correction?) not applied yet
